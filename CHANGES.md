# Changes Made to the Codebase

## 1. Code Organization
- Moved utility packages from `pkg/` to `internal/` to better reflect their application-specific nature:
  - Moved `pkg/logger` to `internal/logger`
  - Moved `pkg/validator` to `internal/validator`
  - Removed `pkg/` directory completely
- Removed unused password validation function from the validator package

## 2. Simplified Database Operations
- Added a central error handling method in the PostgreSQL store to reduce code duplication
- Simplified query construction and error handling across all database methods
- Improved logging with consistent field patterns
- Eliminated the unused `getUserByIDTx` method and inlined the query where needed

## 3. Docker and Database Migrations
- Updated Docker Compose configuration to include a dedicated migrations service
- Modified container orchestration to ensure correct startup order:
  - Database starts first
  - Migrations run after database is healthy
  - API starts after migrations complete successfully
- Removed manual mounting of migration files into PostgreSQL container
- Added environment variable defaults for authentication settings
  
## 4. General Improvements
- Added better error handling across the codebase
- Cleaned up redundant comments
- Updated README documentation to reflect the new project structure and Docker setup
- Ensured the codebase builds successfully after all changes

These changes have:
- Improved maintainability by reducing code duplication
- Enhanced the reliability of database operations
- Made container orchestration more robust
- Followed Go project structure best practices more closely
